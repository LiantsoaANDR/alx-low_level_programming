#0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
**Tasks**

0. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
	_ You can find the source code here
	_ The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
	_ You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
	_ The output of the program should be :
		_ The number, followed by
			_ if the number is greater than 0: is positive
			_ if the number is 0: is zero
			_ if the number is less than 0: is negative
		_ followed by a new line

1. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
	_ You can find the source code here
	_ The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
	_ You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
	_ The output of the program should be:
		_ The string Last digit of, followed by
		_ n, followed by
		_ the string is, followed by
			_ if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
			_ if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
			_ if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
		_ followed by a new line

2. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar twice in your code

3. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar three times in your code

4. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	_ Print all the letters except q and e
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar twice in your code

5. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
	_ All your code should be in the main function

6. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
	_ You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ You can only use putchar twice in your code
	_ All your code should be in the main function

7. Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar twice in your code

8. Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar three times in your code

9. Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
	_ Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
	_ Numbers should be printed in ascending order
	_ You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	_ All your code should be in the main function
	_ You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
	_ You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
